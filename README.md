Multi agents AI search in a labyrinth, each agents has boxes to move into slots. 
This is a partial integration which assumes the goals from each agent aren't too dependant from each other as it searches for each agents solution independantly of the others.
Could benefit from heuristic improvment and concurrent search improvements.
